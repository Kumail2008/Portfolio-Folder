        <h2>Following's are few games designed by me</h2>
        <p>I use javascript to code my games in visual studio code. I use p5.js,p5.play, and matter.js libraries. My favourite game that I coded was the trex runner game!</p>

        <p>This game was coded in p5 web editor. It was the second game I coded in javascript. Coding this game was special because I learned how to code an infinite game and I learned many javascript basics.</p>

        <p>This Angry birds game was very fun to code! I got to learn many new concepts like adding physics to an object using matter.js.</p>
